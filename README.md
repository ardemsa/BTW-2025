Paper: Utilising Large Language Models for Adversarial Attacks in Text-to-SQL: A Perpetrator and Victim Approach

# A Appendix
This appendix provides additional visualisations and performance comparisons supporting the analysis conducted in the main chapters of the paper "Utilising Large Language Models for Adversarial Attacks in Text-to-SQL: A Perpetrator and Victim Approach".

## A.1 Distribution Analysis of Adversarial Attacks
This subsection presents insights in the distributions of attak metrics for different levels of adversarial perturbations.

Distributions of attack metrics: (left) Damerau-Levenshtein distance for character-level attacks, (center) semantic similarity for word-level attacks, and (right) semantic similarity for sentence-level attacks.
